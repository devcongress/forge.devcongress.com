          <h5>What is <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>
            <code>FORGE</code> is the place where rare hackers are <code>FORGE</code>d! It is a platinum-plated anvil on which only the brave and best are born, crafted and carefully <code>FORGE</code>d into immaculate hacking species. Three months is just the beginning of the new and better you. If you go back the same then we have failed. We will pay you for the three months of your life’s worth.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Why should I go to <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>A few reasons. Maybe one or two will resonate with you.</p>
          <p>You studied Computer Science in Ghana but its effect on you is no better than the effect of drug abuse.</p>
          <p>You didn't study Computer Science but you feel that doesn't rob you of your share of the computer cake.</p>
          <p>
            You've been programming for some time now but still feel empty. Deep down in your heart you admit, rather depressingly, to yourself that you write poor code and build mediocre products. But you're getting away with them because you don't know any better. Neither does the next programmer on the block.
          </p>
          <p>
            You contribute to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> by consuming and never stopping to help a fellow out because you honestly think you can't. Neither do you comment on any programmer forum, not even on the liberal land of IRC where bad answers are tolerated, and history is created with no intention of going back.
          </p>
          <p>
            You know you should get better so you're ready to start!
          </p>
          <p>This is the first time you're hearing the phrase <span style="font-family: monospace">it works on my computer.</span></p>
          <p>You are an exceptional programmer, out of work or with a little free time, who wants to hang around.</p>
         <a href="{{ url_for('apply') }}"></a>.

        <div class="question">
          <h5>What are the pre-requisites?</h5>
          <p>
            First of all you should be insane. Insane enough to believe that your can transform your life in 3 months. Second you should be hungry and foolish. So hungry that you will make the most of any given chance and will beat your best performance ever. And be foolish enough to commit your life to that end. Thirdly, you should have evidence to prove you really want this: have an okay programming knowledge.
          </p>

        <div class="question">
          <h5>I don't have any programming experience can I apply?</h5>
          <p>No. <code>FORGE</code> is targeted at programmers with at least 3 months experience only. 3 months doesn't say much about your programming experience except that you have actually expended time and effort to learn to program. We also assume you can spend another 3 months getting better.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>What will I learn at <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>
            <code>FORGE</code> is primarily self-regulated learning so maybe you should tell us. But we have an idea of the kind of programmer you'd become after <code>FORGE</code>. It's generally what great hackers are.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>How much does it cost?</h5>
          <p>
            All good things are free: air, sunlight, water, life and <code>FORGE</code>!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Do you provide accommodation and food?</h5>
          <p>
            We hope you are not homeless (although that is not a prerequisite). We have no accommodation arrangements at the moment. But that will soon be a thing of the past. We want to rule your entire life so we will give accommodation in the near future. But feel free to talk to us about it. We will do our best to help.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>How long is <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>
            Just enough time for you to survive. 3 months: Day. Night. Weekend.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>What kind of projects will I work on?</h5>
            We know at least 3 sources of projects:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Your own projects</h4>
                You can continue working on your existing projects. One requirement though: they should be open source.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Existing open source projects</h4>
                During the program we'd have fun digging into existing libraries and projects in all sort of languages. Perhaps you'd want to contribute documentation or send patches for bugs you discover.
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Working with resident experts on their open source projects</h4>
                We'd bring in resources in people. We call them <em>Resident Experts</em> (we didn't invent that, it's an industry term). If they have new ideas for or existing open source projects that you wanna help them with, we ok that!
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do you have projects you are working on already? You can bring them in. The requirement is they <strong>should</strong> be open source.</p>
            <p>During the program we'd have fun digging into existing libraries and projects in all sorts of languages, perhaps perverting them in all sorts of ways. Perhaps you'd want to write documentation for them or send patch for a bug you discovered.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Can I do less than 12 weeks</h5>
          <p>No.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Can I do this part-time?</h5>
          <p>
            <code>FORGE</code> is a full-time program.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Will I have to bring my own laptop?</h5>
          <p>
            Yes, and you should have an operating system already installed. Even better if you set it up with your favorite text editors, IDEs, and programming language compilers and VMs.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>How many hours will I commit a day?</h5>
          <p>
            <code>FORGE</code> is as full-time as full-time job so expect to commit at least 8 hours per day for 5 days a week. It doesn't mean 8 hours of continuous instruction. No. We believe that (too much) classes will destroy any potential for authentic creativity so we've reduced the number of lecture sessions per week to only specific days and a total of about 5 hours.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>What happens after <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>
            Hard labour! <code>FORGE</code>! is no play ground. It is a life and death matter. In 3 months, we are going to transform you into a world class programmer. That should give you a clue. We will drive you. Push you beyond your limits, challenge all your assumptions and best efforts, we will destroy your comfort zone. We will own you for 3 months. Your life will not be the same.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Is <code>FORGE</code> an accredited educational institute?</h5>
          <p>Umm, no. And honestly we'd never be! We think accredition adds unnecessary pressure and useless recognition. We also believe our accreditation will come by virtue of the value we'd provide and the fine quality performance you'd render after going through the program.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Will get a certificate after the programme?</h5>
          <p>
            Even though we also think <a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/">Github is not your CV</a>, we
            don't subscribe to that fully. Throughout your time at <code>FORGE</code> you'd work on a lot of project (both open and closed source) that interest you. You'd also have a very active blog documenting your everyday progress during <code>FORGE</code>.
            These 2 (<a href="https://github.com">Github</a> and your blogposts) will be your external evidence your skills.<br> So no, we don't award certificates. You should concentrate on building an almost irresistible portfolio.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
          <h5>Can you guarantee that I will get a job after <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
          <p>
            Even though <code>FORGE</code> only makes money off of you when you successfully land a job after the program, we can't guarantee job placement. We encourage you to entertain recruiters who would contact you during any period of the program. Don't postpone until the final lap before you start searching for a job.<br> We'd also invite a lot of potential employers during the course of the program to interact with you, passively assess you. Be assured though that we'd work our butts off, together with you, to get you a well paying job. Because that's the only way we make money.

        <div class="question">
          <h5>What is the hacker's creed?</h5>
          <p>I am a hacker. It doesn’t mean I am a criminal or that I use my computer superpowers for evil.</p>
          <p>It means I continuously apply myself to learning and creating value with the computer as my primary tool. I never quit. I embrace challenges. I seek out problems and make them sorry. I go out of my way to provide elegant and jaw-dropping solutions to problems of significance. This is how I was <code>FORGE</code>d: through blood, sweat and tears I earn my hacker’s crest.</p>
          <p>I am a hacker. I am thus <code>FORGE</code>d!</p>
