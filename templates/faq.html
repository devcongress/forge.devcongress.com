                                          You've been programming for some time now but still feel empty. Deep down in your heart you admit, rather depressingly, to yourself that you write poor code and build mediocre products. But you're getting away with them because you don't know any better. Neither does the next programmer on the block.

                                          You contribute to <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> by consuming and never stopping to help a fellow out because you honestly think you can't. Neither do you comment on any programmer forum, not even on the liberal land of IRC where bad answers are tolerated, and history is created with no intention of going back.

It doesn't mean 8 hours of continuous instruction. No. We believe that (too much) classes will destroy any potential for authentic creativity so we've reduced the number of lecture sessions per week to only specific days and a total of about 5 hours.</small>

Be assured though that we'd work our butts off, together with you, to get you a well paying job. Because that's the only way we make money.</small>
