				<h5>What is <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
				<p>
					<code>FORGE</code> is the place where rare hackers are <code>FORGE</code>D! It is an intense anvil on which only the brave and best are born, crafted and carefully <code>FORGE</code>d into immaculate hacking species. Three months is just the beginning of the new and better you. If you go back the same then we have failed. We will pay you for the three months of your life’s worth.
				</p>
				<h5>Why should I go to <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
				<p>
					You don’t have to go to <code>FORGE</code> unless you are an exceptional person, driven, intelligent and determined to make a difference with your life: a difference women will sing about and dance at full moons, parents will name their children after you, and children will read about in school. If you are not that kind, then go on and live your sorry life. We are in the business of making history. Now move over!

					But if you are then <a href="{{ url_for('apply') }}">prove it</a>.

				</p>
				<h5>What are the pre-requisites?</h5>
				<p>
					First of all you should be insane. Insane enough to believe that your can transform your life in 3 months. Second you should be hungry and foolish. So hungry that you will make the most of any given chance and will beat your best performance ever. And be foolish enough to commit your life to that end. Thirdly, you should have evidence to prove you really want this: have programming knowledge and worked on something significant before.(Git/BitBucket is your witness).

				<p>
					
				</p>

					You will learn how to talk and think like a true hacker. You will learn how to make the computer do WHATEVER you want it to DO for you. You will create the spectacular out of nothing. You will invent, innovate and lead!

				</p>

				</p>
				<h5>How long is <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
				<p>
					Just enough time for you to survive. 3 months: Day. Night. Weekend.
				</p>
				<h5>What kind of projects will I work on?</h5>
				<p>
					Anything you are passionate about. But it better make sense and prove value for humanity. Else, keep digging till you come up with one.
				</p>

				<h5>What happens after <code>FORGE</code>?</h5>
				<p>
					Hard labour! <code>FORGE</code>! is no play ground. It is a life and death matter. In 3 months, we are going to transform you into a world class programmer. That should give you a clue. We will drive you. Push you beyond your limits, challenge all your assumptions and best efforts, we will destroy your comfort zone. We will own you for 3 months. Your life will not be the same.

					partners. But getting a job is based on your ability
					to impress your potential employers.
				</p>
				<h5>What is the hacker's creed?</h5>
				<p style="font-style: italic;">
					I am a hacker. It doesn’t mean I am a criminal or that I use my computer superpowers for evil. 

					It means I continuously apply myself to learning and creating value with the computer as my primary tool. I never quit. I embrace challenges. I seek out problems and make them sorry. I go out of my way to provide elegant and jaw-dropping solutions to problems of significance. This is how I was <code>FORGE</code>d: through blood, sweat and tears I earn my hacker’s crest. 

					I am a hacker. I am thus <code>FORGE</code>d!
